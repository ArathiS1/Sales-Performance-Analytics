## Problem Statement
The sales leadership team lacks a unified, real-time view of performance across regions, channels, and product categories. This leads to:
- Delayed decision-making due to manual report consolidation.
- Ineffective resource allocation as high-potential products and regions are not clearly identified.
- Inability to proactively address customer churn and return rate issues, directly impacting profitability.

## Solution & Objectives
This interactive Power BI dashboard serves as a single source of truth for the sales organization, designed to:
- **Identify Key Growth Levers:** Pinpoint top-performing products, regions, and customer segments.
- **Diagnose Operational Issues:** Analyze return rates and customer behavior to mitigate revenue loss.
- **Track Performance Trends:** Monitor Year-over-Year (YoY) growth and Average Order Value (AOV).
- **Enable Data-Driven Decisions:** Provide self-service analytics to sales and marketing teams.

## Tools Used
Power BI ‚Ä¢ SQL ‚Ä¢ DAX ‚Ä¢ Excel

## Methodology & Process
**Data Acquisition & Cleaning:** Raw sales data extracted from the SQL database.  
**Data Modeling:** Star-schema with `Fact_Sales` and dimensions (`Date`, `Product`, `Customer`, `Region`).  
**DAX & Measure Engineering:** KPIs like Total Sales LY, YoY Growth, Return Rate, AOV.  
**Interactive Visualization:** Drillable dashboards.  
**Insight Synthesis:** Actionable recommendations for decision-making.

## Results & Business Impact
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **High-Value Customer Concentration Risk:** Top 7 customers contribute ~$36K of $8.41M revenue.  
  **Recommendation:** Key account management + cross-sell program.
- üöÄ **Massive Growth in Electronics:** *Phone B* drives $6.38M (79%) of revenue.  
  **Recommendation:** Promote accessories to lift AOV & LTV.
- üìà **Strong Performance:** 64.86% YoY growth, AOV $700.97, return rate 0.04%.  
  **Recommendation:** Maintain quality focus; scale campaigns.
- üåç **Regional & Channel Analysis:** Re-allocate budgets to high-performing channels in underpenetrated regions.

FROM SalesByYear
ORDER BY ProductName, OrderYear;
